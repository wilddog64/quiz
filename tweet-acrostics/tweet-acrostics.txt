Tweet Acrostics is a program that tries composes an acrostics from tweets.txt and 
verifies that acrostics is a valid word by looking up words-lowercase.txt

The language that I used to solve the problem is perl and there are no libraries used

There's a perl script, acrostic.pl, and an output file, acrostics.out.txt
